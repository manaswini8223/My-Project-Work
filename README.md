Mini Project - File Integrity Monitoring Systems:
 In the contemporary landscape of cybersecurity, the File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system stands as a stalwart 
guardian, addressing the escalating challenges posed by unauthorized access and tampering of critical files within 
computer systems and networks. This abstract delves into the essence of FIM, elucidating its significance, 
functionalities, and overarching contributions to the security posture of organizations. File Integrity Monitoring 
operates on the principle of upholding the integrity and security of digital assets. It entails continuous surveillance 
of files, directories, and system configurations, with the primary goal of swiftly detecting and responding to any 
deviations from the established baseline. FIM systems serve as vigilant sentinels, providing real-time alerts and 
responses to a spectrum of security incidents, from insidious malware infiltrations to potential insider threats. The 
multifaceted role of FIM extends beyond the immediate realm of cybersecurity. By ensuring the sanctity of data 
and configurations, FIM systems contribute to regulatory compliance, aligning organizations with industry 
standards and frameworks. This compliance is essential for instilling confidence among stakeholders and 
demonstrating a commitment to the safeguarding of sensitive information.


//Major Project - Precision Vulnerabilities Via Linux

Precision vulnerability analysis is a critical process in assessing and mitigating potential 
risks within complex systems and environments. This analysis involves meticulous 
examination and identification of vulnerabilities that could compromise the accuracy, 
reliability, or security of systems, software, or data. The focus is on identifying 
vulnerabilities that may not be apparent through conventional assessments, thereby 
enhancing the overall resilience of systems against potential threats. This project is a 
Python-based web vulnerability scanner. It automates the identification of  common 
security issues like SQL injection and XSS in web applications. By systematically crawling 
web pages and generating detailed reports, the tool provides a proactive approach to 
enhancing web application security
